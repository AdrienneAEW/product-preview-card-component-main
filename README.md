## My process

Was to focus on designing with just HTML/CSS a sort of review of the basics. I started by building the design using two frameworks (grid and flexbox) and then worked on upping my SCSS game by setting up a global styles file with mixins and global styles. There isn't much in the file, however, it's forcing me to think more like a designer and what elements are usable across projects. In other words, I'm learning more about Sass and how to build components.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass

### What I learned

It never hurts to go back to the basics from time to time and this challenge was a refresher for me in that regard. Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Nonetheless, I learned did gain a deeper understanding of how GitHub works and able to correct a few mistakes with my deployments. 

I hardly evern use the html <picture></picture> tag, but I couldn't get it to work so abandonned it for this challenge. The plan is to start practicing with the tag and using it in furture designs.

For years I've developed pages from a mobile first prespective. If I am honest this approach always seemed clunky to me, so I'm experimenting with a desktop to mobile approach. And am not suprised to see that this approach requires less code and is a lot more readable.

### Continued development

Learning, practicing and deploying with GitHub is an area of development I want to continue to focus on. As doing a complete review of CSS and HTML and get better acquainted with the new additions from the last updates.
